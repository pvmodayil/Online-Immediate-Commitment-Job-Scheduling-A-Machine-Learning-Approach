# Online-Immediate-Commitment-Job-Scheduling-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
Experiment with a Machine Learning approach for job scheduling on parallel machines with immediate commitment.  This project aims at studying the possibilities for the machine to learn something from the job scheduling environment. The machine should then be able to accept or reject the incoming job with immediate commitment, based on its judgement of the current states of the machines and the properties of the incoming job.

# Overview:
In this repositiory you will find the python script prepared in jupyter notebook for the implemented machine learning approach. 
The file: OnlineImmediateCommitmentJobScheduling_AMachineLearningApproach.ipynb will run the learning part and 
the file: OnlineImmediateCommitmentJobScheduling_AMachineLearningApproach_Test.ipynb will run the testing part.

files: Results_D11 and Results_D12 contains the testing results obtained from averaging over the results for job files S1-S10 for each slack, SD and machine combination.
files: Results_D13_S1_S10 and Results_D14_S1_S10 contains the testing results obtained for each of the job files S1-S10 for each slack, SD and machine combination.

file: Online Immediate Commitment Job Scheduling A Machine Learning Approach.pdf is the report prepared on the entire experiment.
